        Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा Sagarmāthā) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level,
         located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. 
        The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.

        <h3>Namche Bazaar</h3>
        <p>
          Namche Bazaar is popular with trekkers in the Khumbu region, especially for altitude acclimatization, and is the gateway to the high Himalaya. 
          The town has a number of lodgings and stores catering to the needs of visitors as well as a number of internet cafés.
           Here are our top three resorts:

        <h3>Lukla</h3>
        
        <p>
          Lukla contains a small airport servicing the region, and a variety of shops and lodges catering to tourists and trekkers, providing western-style meals and trail supplies.
          From Lukla, travellers will take two days to reach the village Namche Bazaar, an altitude acclimatization stop for those continuing on.
          In August 2014, the Nepalese government announced plans to open the first tarmac road from Kathmandu to Lukla.
          Lukla is served by the Tenzing-Hillary Airport.
